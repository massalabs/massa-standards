# Massa Standard Definition

Welcome to the Massa Standard Definition project!

This project aims to establish a common set of standards for the Massa blockchain ecosystem. The standards defined here will help to promote interoperability and ease of use for Massa-based applications and services.

If you're interested in learning more about Massa and its capabilities, check out the following resources:

- [Massa website](https://massa.net): This is the official website for the Massa blockchain. Here, you can learn more about Massa's features and use cases, as well as explore the Massa ecosystem and community.
- [Massa documentation](https://docs.massa.net/en/latest/): This is the official documentation for Massa. Here, you can find detailed guides and tutorials for developing on the Massa blockchain, as well as API reference documentation for the Massa SDK and other tools.

## Fungible Token

The [Fungible Token standard implementation](smart-contracts/assembly/contracts/FT) defines a common set of rules for creating and managing Massa-based tokens that are fungible (i.e. interchangeable).

This is MassaLabs implementation of [the ERC20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/).

## Non-Fungible Token

The [Non-Fungible Token standard implementation](smart-contracts/assembly/contracts/NFT) defines a common set of rules for creating and managing Massa-based tokens that are non-fungible (i.e. unique).

This is MassaLabs implementation of [the ERC721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/).

## Massa Units

The [Massa Units standard](units.md) defines a set of common units of measurement for use on the Massa blockchain.

These units include:

- Massa coin
- Gas
- Rolls

## DApps <> Wallet Provider Communication

The [DApps <> Wallet Provider Communication standard](wallet/dapps-communication.md) defines a common interface for communication between Massa-based decentralized applications (DApps) and wallet providers.

This standard aims to simplify the process of integrating Massa-based DApps with various wallet providers, making it easier for end-users to access and use these applications.
